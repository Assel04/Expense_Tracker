# Expense Tracker

This is a Flutter application for tracking expenses. It allows users to add, delete, and filter transactions by category and period. The app also provides analytics on total expenses, income, and net balance.

## Getting Started

To run the Expense Tracker app on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```dart
git clone https://github.com/your_username/expense_tracker.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```dart
cd expense_tracker
```

3. Install dependencies: 

```dart
flutter pub get
```

4. Run the app:

## Architecture

The Expense Tracker app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. It separates the UI (View) from the business logic (ViewModel) and the data model (Model). This separation of concerns allows for better maintainability and testability of the codebase.

*Delete Transactions*: Users can delete selected transactions.
*Filter Transactions*: Users can filter transactions by category and period (day, week, month, year).
